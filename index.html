          <p>Why would you choose a FLIR thermal imaging camera? There are other technologies available to help you measure temperatures in a non-contact mode. Infrared thermometers, for example. </p>

<p>Infrared thermometers - thermal imaging cameras
Infrared (IR) thermometers are reliable and very useful for single spot temperature readings, but, for scanning large areas or components, it’s easy to miss critical components that may be near failure and need repair.</p>

<p>A FLIR thermal imaging camera can scan entire motors, components, or panels at once - never missing any overheating hazards, no matter how small.</p>

<p>Find problems faster and easier with extreme accuracy.
It’s easy to miss critical problems with a spot IR thermometer. A FLIR thermal imaging camera scans entire components giving you instant diagnostic insights showing the full extent of problems.</p>

<p>Use thousands of infrared thermometers at the same time
With an infrared thermometer you are able to measure the temperature at one single spot. FLIR thermal imaging cameras can measure temperatures on the entire image. The FLIR i3 has an image resolution of 60 x 60 pixels. This means that it is equal to using 3,600 IR thermometers at the same time. If we look at the FLIR P660, our top model, which has an image resolution of 640 x 480 pixels, this means 307,200 pixels or using 307,200 infrared thermometers at the same time.</p>
